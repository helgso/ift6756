# IFT 6756 - Final Project

Here, I explore AlphaZero, the work of [David Silver et al. [2018]](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6419/1140),
which is a general reinforcement learning algorithm. Specifically, I will be exploring the MCTS by tackling a 9x9 version Go.

## Setup:

Use a python3 environment to:
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- Install https://github.com/aigagror/GymGo by following their instructions
- Fetch elopy.py from https://github.com/HankSheehan/EloPy

## Disclaimer:

I used DeepMind's pseudocode as a base for implementing AlphaZero, available in the supplementary **Data S1** available [here](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6419/1140/tab-figures-data).
